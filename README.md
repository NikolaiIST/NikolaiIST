Hi! I'm NicolÃ¡s Matheus, a systems and telecommunications engineering student at Universidad Catolica de Pereira (Colombia) ðŸŒ±.

I consider myself a self-taught person passionate about technology, especially programming. My favorite language is Java, but I also have experience in C++, C# and Python. ðŸ‘†ðŸ¤“

In web development, I know JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React, and I also have knowledge of SQL databases.

One of my future goals is the creation of 2D games from 16 to 32 Bits.ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘¾

Besides programming, I love to read and learn about new technologies. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge.

In my free time, I like to spend time with my friends and family, play video games and listen to music.

If you have a project in mind, feel free to contact me - I'm always willing to help!

I'm excited to see what the future of technology has to offer. I'm sure it will continue to play an important role in our lives.

Thanks for visiting my profile!

I look forward to working with you in the future!

Best regards!
