# About Me
Hi! I'm NicolÃ¡s Matheus, a systems and telecommunications engineering student at Universidad Catolica de Pereira (Colombia) ðŸŒ±.

I consider myself a self-taught person passionate about technology, especially programming. My favorite language is Java, but I also have experience in C++, C# and Python. In web development, I know JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React, and I also have knowledge of SQL databases.ðŸ‘†ðŸ¤“

</p>

My native language is Spanish, but I have a B2 level of English, I have the ability to maintain a conversation with a native speaker (Don't ask me for an English certificate, trust me please).

One of my future goals is the creation of 2D games from 16 to 32 Bits.ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘¾

</p>

Besides programming, I love to read and learn about new technologies. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge.

If you have a project in mind, feel free to contact me - I'm always willing to help!

I'm excited to see what the future of technology has to offer. I'm sure it will continue to play an important role in our lives.
